How to start
------------

[Add your bot to a Discord server ](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html).

Create `config.json` file in the working directory and fill properties: 

```$json
{
    token: 'token for your bot',
    prefix: 'prefix for commands'
}
```

In command line run `npm run start`

Ok, for now your bot can handle `bedtime` command. Enjoy!
